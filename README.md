# eCommerce-Application

Welcome to our eCommerce application! This platform replicates real-world shopping experiences in a digital environment 🏪. It's a comprehensive online shopping portal that provides an interactive and seamless experience to users. From product discovery to checkout, the application ensures a smooth journey for the user, enhancing their engagement and boosting their purchasing confidence 🚀.

Users can browse through a vast range of products 📚👗👟, view detailed descriptions, add their favorite items to the basket 🛒, and proceed to checkout 💳. It includes features such as user registration and login 📝🔐, product search 🔍, product categorization, and sorting to make the shopping experience more streamlined and convenient.

### Project goal

Develop a fully functional single-page e-commerce application that provides users with an interactive and convenient experience from product search to order placement, using TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve application scalability.

### Technologies Used

**TypeScript:** for ensuring type safety and improving the scalability of the application.  
**CommerceTools:** for integrating with the e-commerce platform, setting up the project, and creating the API client.  
**GitHub:** for code storage, version control, and collaboration.  
**Project Management Tool (Trello):** for task management, team organization, and progress tracking.  
**Bundler (Vite):** for building the project and supporting various build modes.  
**ESLint:** for ensuring consistent code style and identifying potential issues.  
**Prettier:** for automatic code formatting and readability.  
**Husky:** for managing Git hooks and automating tasks such as code checking and formatting during commits.  
**Testing Framework (Vitest):** for writing and running tests that ensure code functionality.  
**Development Scripts:** for executing tasks during development, such as running ESLint, Prettier, and tests.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **npm run dev:** Runs the app in development mode using Vite.
- **npm run build:** Builds the app for production, including running Vitest for tests, TypeScript compilation, and Vite build.
- **npm run preview:** Runs the built app in preview mode using Vite.
- **npm run format:** Formats all files in the src directory using Prettier.
- **npm run ci:format:** Checks if all files in the src directory are formatted correctly using Prettier without applying changes.
- **npm run lint:** Lints all files in the src directory and fixes fixable issues using ESLint.
- **npm run ci:lint:** Checks for linting issues in all files in the src directory using ESLint without fixing them.
- **npm run prepare:** Runs Husky's prepare script.
- **npm run bash:pre-commit:** Runs the pre-commit Bash script.
- **npm run bash:pre-push:** Runs the pre-push Bash script.
- **npm run husky:pre-commit:** Runs Husky's pre-commit hook.
- **npm run husky:pre-push:** Runs Husky's pre-push hook.
- **npm test:** Runs Vitest to execute tests.
- **npm run test:coverage:** Runs Vitest with coverage reporting to check how much of your code is covered by tests.

Each script's usage and purpose are described above to help you utilize them effectively during development and testing processes.
